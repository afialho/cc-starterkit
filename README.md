# cc-starterkit

Stack-agnostic AI development starter kit for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code).

Build **any software from zero to production** -- a to-do list, a SaaS platform, a Pipefy clone, a Netflix-scale app. Or start simple with an MVP and evolve. It also works on **existing codebases**: add new features, refactor messy code, redesign the UI, modernize the architecture, or fix bugs -- all with the same toolkit.

27 skills, 8 deterministic hooks, 6 architecture patterns, 3 project scales. One command to start.

---

## The Magic: `/build`

This is the heart of the kit. **You type one command and the entire software lifecycle runs autonomously.**

```
/build a project management app like Pipefy with boards, cards, automations and team collaboration
```

That single command triggers a full pipeline:

```
/build <your idea>
  |
  |  Phase 0 -- Understand
  |  Detects what you need and auto-routes:
  |    No project yet?     --> scaffolds from scratch
  |    Idea is vague?      --> interviews you to clarify, then resumes
  |    Want to transform?  --> routes to /redesign, /refactor, or /modernize
  |    Clear feature?      --> continues below
  |
  |  Phase 1 -- Research                           [parallel agents]
  |  Launches up to 6 specialized agents that search the web:
  |  market analysis, API docs, architecture patterns, domain rules,
  |  real implementations, video tutorials. Produces RESEARCH.md.
  |  Pauses to show key insights and ask clarifying questions.
  |
  |  Phase 2 -- Planning                           [informed by research]
  |  Generates BDD scenarios (Gherkin), architecture mapping for your
  |  detected pattern, test plan, agent wave decomposition.
  |  Produces PLAN.md. Pauses for your approval.
  |
  |  Phase 3 -- Implementation                     [TDD + agent waves]
  |  Foundation first (design system + layout), auth gate, then features.
  |  Each feature: failing test --> implementation --> review --> QA gate.
  |  Parallel agents, structured handoffs, automatic fix loops.
  |  Commits, reports, done.
```

It works for a weekend hackathon (`scale=MVP`) or a production launch (`scale=Product`). You choose the level of rigor; the kit enforces it.

---

## Quick Start

**One-liner** (no clone needed):

```bash
bash <(curl -s "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/afialho/cc-starterkit/main/scripts/new-project.sh?t=$(date +%s)") my-app
```

This clones the kit, initializes a fresh git history, runs setup, and leaves you ready to go.

**Then:**

```bash
cd my-app
claude
/build <your idea>
```

**Manual setup** (if you prefer):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/afialho/cc-starterkit.git my-project
cd my-project
chmod +x scripts/setup.sh && ./scripts/setup.sh
# Edit CLAUDE.md: replace [Project Name]
claude
```

**For existing codebases** (one-liner, run from your project root):

```bash
bash <(curl -s "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/afialho/cc-starterkit/main/scripts/adopt.sh?t=$(date +%s)")
```

This installs skills, hooks, and config into your project without touching your code. Then:

```bash
claude
/adapt              # auto-detects your stack and configures everything
/build new feature  # or /refactor, /redesign, /modernize
```

See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for full details, import rules, and configuration examples.

## Project Scales

Scale determines what practices and tooling are included. Set via `/ideate` or passed directly: `/build scale=MVP`.

| | MVP | Product | Scale |
|---|-----|---------|-------|
| **When** | POC, hackathon, prototype | Going to market, early stage | Traction, growing team |
| **TDD** | Advisory | Required | Required |
| **BDD (Gherkin)** | Optional | Required | Required |
| **Hexagonal layers** | Advisory | Required | Required |
| **E2E (Cypress)** | Optional | Required | Required |
| **CI/CD** | Optional | Required | Required |
| **Load tests (k6)** | -- | Optional | Required |
| **Observability** | -- | Structured logging | OpenTelemetry + Grafana |

All scales enforce: auth gate, security scan, Docker, Conventional Commits.

## Hooks

8 hooks in `.claude/hooks/` provide deterministic enforcement and advisory context.

| Hook | Trigger | What It Does |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `architecture-guard` | Write/Edit to source files | **Blocks** domain/application imports of infrastructure packages. Injects layer rules as context. |
| `rules-engine` | All tool calls | **Blocks** `--no-verify` on commits, test files inside `src/`. Enforces hard rules from Rules.md. |
| `commit-guard` | Bash: `git commit` | **Blocks** commits not following Conventional Commits format. |
| `docker-guard` | Session start | **Blocks** session start if `docker-compose.yml` exists but Docker is not running. |
| `security-scan` | Write/Edit | **Blocks** files containing hardcoded secrets, API keys, or credentials. |
| `tdd-guard` | Write to implementation files | Advisory: reminds to write tests first when no corresponding test file exists. |
| `rtk-rewrite` | Every Bash command | Advisory: suggests RTK CLI prefix for token-efficient operations. |
| `session-start` | Session startup/resume | Injects project context, checkpoint data, and architecture info. |

Hooks using `exit 2` are fully deterministic (the action is cancelled). Advisory hooks inject context that strongly influences but does not force behavior. See [docs/HOOKS.md](docs/HOOKS.md) for the full breakdown.

## Autonomous Agents

Complex features are implemented using waves of parallel agents, each handling one granular task.

```
/feature-dev payment-processing

Claude (orchestrator):
  Wave 1: [explorer-1, explorer-2]            -- explore codebase
  Wave 2: [planner, bdd-writer]               -- plan + BDD scenarios
  Wave 3: [test-writer, implementer-domain]   -- TDD domain layer
  Wave 4: [implementer-app, implementer-infra, test-integration] -- full stack
  Wave 5: [reviewer, e2e-writer]              -- quality gates
```

Constraints:
- Maximum 5 agents in parallel per wave
- Each agent handles exactly 1 granular activity
- 100k token budget per agent context
- Structured handoffs between waves (no context loss)
- Reviewer agent is mandatory before marking a feature complete

## Testing Stack

| Layer | Tool | Location | Required At |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| Unit | Framework-native (Vitest, Jest, Pytest, etc.) | `tests/unit/` | All scales |
| BDD | Cucumber.js | `tests/bdd/features/` | Product, Scale |
| E2E | Cypress | `tests/e2e/` | Product, Scale |
| Load | k6 | `tests/load/` | Scale |

See [docs/TESTING.md](docs/TESTING.md) for the full testing strategy.
