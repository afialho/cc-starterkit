# Rules.md — Project Rules & Constraints

> Rules marked **[AUTO]** are enforced deterministically by hooks in `.claude/settings.json`.
> All other rules are enforced through code review and the continuous improvement loop.

---

## Architecture Rules

### RULE-ARCH-001 [AUTO]
**Domain layer has zero external dependencies.**
- Files in `src/domain/` may only import from `src/domain/` and `src/shared/`
- No database, HTTP framework, ORM, or third-party library imports in domain
- Domain entities and value objects are pure: no I/O, no side effects
- *Enforcement: architecture-guard hook warns on Write/Edit to domain files*

### RULE-ARCH-002 [AUTO]
**Application layer depends only on domain and ports.**
- Files in `src/application/` import from `src/domain/`, `src/ports/`, and `src/shared/`
- No direct infrastructure imports (no DB clients, no HTTP clients) in application
- Use cases depend on port interfaces, never on concrete adapters
- *Enforcement: architecture-guard hook warns on Write/Edit to application files*

### RULE-ARCH-003
**Every infrastructure adapter implements a port interface.**
- Each file in `src/infrastructure/` must have a corresponding interface in `src/ports/`
- Example: `src/infrastructure/persistence/PostgresUserRepository.ts` implements `src/ports/outbound/UserRepository.ts`

### RULE-ARCH-004
**Dependency injection at the composition root.**
- Infrastructure adapters are injected into use cases, never instantiated inside them
- The composition root (entry point) is the only place that wires concrete implementations to ports

### RULE-ARCH-005
**No circular dependencies between layers.**
- Domain → nothing
- Application → Domain, Ports
- Ports → Domain only
- Infrastructure → Ports, Domain, Application (for use case wiring only)
- Shared → nothing else

## Testing Rules

### RULE-TEST-001 [AUTO]
**Write tests before implementation (TDD).**
- The RED phase (failing test) must precede the GREEN phase (implementation)
- Commit history should show test commits before implementation commits
- *Enforcement: tdd-guard hook adds context reminder when writing implementation files*

### RULE-TEST-002
**Every feature has BDD scenarios written before implementation starts.**
- Gherkin feature files in `tests/bdd/features/` exist before code is written
- Use `/plan` to generate BDD scenarios as part of planning

### RULE-TEST-003
**Every domain and application file has a corresponding unit test.**
- `src/domain/X.ts` → `tests/unit/domain/X.test.ts`
- `src/application/Y.ts` → `tests/unit/application/Y.test.ts`
- Coverage target: 100% of business logic

### RULE-TEST-004
**Every infrastructure adapter has an integration test.**
- `src/infrastructure/Z.ts` → `tests/integration/Z.test.ts`
- Integration tests hit real or containerized dependencies (no mocks for external services)
- Domain objects are real — only external service dependencies may be mocked in integration tests

### RULE-TEST-005
**Load tests for every new API endpoint.**
- `tests/load/[endpoint-name].js` created for every new HTTP endpoint
- Baseline: p95 < 200ms at expected steady load
- Stress test: system stable at 2x expected peak
- Run with: `k6 run tests/load/[endpoint-name].js`

### RULE-TEST-006
**Cypress tests for every user-facing flow.**
- `tests/e2e/[feature-name].cy.ts` for every new user journey
- Covers happy path + key error states

### RULE-TEST-007
**No tests that test implementation details.**
- Tests verify behavior (what the code does), not implementation (how it does it)
- Refactoring must not break tests unless behavior changes

---

## Code Quality Rules

### RULE-CODE-001
**Single Responsibility Principle.**
- Each class: one reason to change
- Each function: one responsibility
- Functions < 20 lines (prefer < 10)
- Classes < 200 lines (prefer < 100)

### RULE-CODE-002
**No magic numbers or strings.**
- All constants defined with descriptive names
- Domain constants in `src/domain/constants/`
- Configuration values in `src/shared/config/`

### RULE-CODE-003
**Names reveal intent.**
- No single-letter variables (except loop indices)
- No abbreviations unless universally understood (id, url, db, api)
- Booleans: `isActive`, `hasPermission`, `canEdit`, `shouldRetry`
- Functions: verb + noun (`getUserById`, `processPayment`, `validateEmail`)
- No `data`, `info`, `manager`, `handler`, `util`, `helper` as standalone names

### RULE-CODE-004
**No dead code.**
- Remove unused imports, variables, functions, classes
- No commented-out code blocks (use git history)
- No TODO comments older than one sprint (convert to tracked issues)

### RULE-CODE-005
**Dependency Inversion.**
- Depend on interfaces/abstract types, never on concrete implementations
- Constructor injection preferred over property or method injection
- No `new ConcreteClass()` inside business logic

### RULE-CODE-006
**No defensive programming inside domain.**
- Domain assumes valid input (validate at application layer boundaries)
- Application layer validates all inputs before calling domain
- Infrastructure validates all external inputs

---

## Git Workflow Rules

### RULE-GIT-001
**Use worktrees for parallel feature development.**
```bash
rtk git worktree add ../[project]-[feature] -b feature/[feature-name]
```
- Each independent feature/task: separate worktree
- Never develop two unrelated features in the same working tree

### RULE-GIT-002
**Atomic commits with descriptive messages.**
- One logical change per commit
- Format: `type(scope): short description`
- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `test`, `refactor`, `docs`, `chore`, `perf`
- Example: `test(auth): add unit tests for LoginUseCase`

### RULE-GIT-003
**No commits with failing tests.**
- Run all tests before committing
- Pre-commit: `rtk npm test` (or equivalent)
- Never use `--no-verify`

### RULE-GIT-004
**Test commits precede implementation commits.**
- Git history must show: BDD scenario → unit test → implementation → refactor
- This is the TDD paper trail

---

## Efficiency Rules

### RULE-EFF-001 [AUTO]
**Use RTK CLI for all commands.**
- Prefix all CLI commands with `rtk`: `rtk git status`, `rtk npm test`, `rtk ls -la`
- RTK provides 60-90% token savings on dev operations
- *Enforcement: rtk-rewrite hook adds context on every Bash tool call*

### RULE-EFF-002
**Prefer CLI over MCP.**
- When a CLI tool exists, use it instead of MCP
- CLI results are faster, deterministic, and token-efficient
- Use MCP only when no CLI alternative exists

### RULE-EFF-003
**Minimal file reads.**
- Use `Glob` and `Grep` before `Read` on large codebases
- Read only files needed for the current task
- Never read entire directories speculatively

---

## Agent Rules

### RULE-AGENT-001
**Maximum 5 agents in parallel.**
- Never launch more than 5 concurrent Agent tool calls
- If task needs more, create additional waves (sequential)

### RULE-AGENT-002
**Each agent executes exactly 1 granular activity.**
- If a task takes more than 30 minutes, decompose it further
- "Implement authentication" is NOT a valid single-agent task
- "Write unit test for LoginUseCase.execute() — invalid password case" IS valid

### RULE-AGENT-003
**Maximum 100k tokens per agent context.**
- Each agent monitors its token budget
- Write partial handoff before approaching the limit
- Signal orchestrator to spawn a continuation agent

### RULE-AGENT-004
**Context handoff required after every wave.**
- Every agent produces a structured handoff (see Agents.md for format)
- Orchestrator aggregates handoffs before starting next wave

### RULE-AGENT-005
**Reviewers are mandatory before marking a feature complete.**
- Every feature goes through at least one code-reviewer agent
- Review checks: architecture compliance, SOLID, test coverage, clean code

## Machine-Checkable Rules Configuration

Hooks read `.claude/architecture.json` for layer validation.
See `.claude/hooks/` for all automated enforcement scripts.
